# Hermit Tracker

A simple utility Android app for tracking your progress through every
[Hermitcraft](https://hermitcraft.com/) video

Note: This app is completely unofficial and the Hermitcraft members have nothing
to do with it

## Usage

Tap on the cards to open the videos. The menu button on the side allows you to
mark the video as watched, hiding it.
